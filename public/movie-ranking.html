<h1>The Best Movies According to Rajdip</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>
  This movie brings a tear to your eyes. If you want to cry and melt down to a
  glamurous love story, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie. Titanic
  is well worth seeing.

<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>
  Avatar brings forward the true nature of how humans have chosen to treat the
  land.
</p>
<h3>Life of Pi</h3>
<p>
  Life of Pi is an exhilarating drama about the mysteries which light up our
  lives and have no rhyme or reason on their own; the faith that enables us to
  make a leap into the dark; the teachings of animals; the fierce and tranquil
  sides of nature; and the powerful instinct we all have for survival.
